;;; color-mode.el --- minor mode for colorizing lines of a file

;; Don Knuth, August 2000
;; (I use this for files that inventory my library and preprints etc.)

;; When using this mode you can colorize the current line with various
;; colors called color-@, color-a, color-b, etc., by saying
;; "C-c@", "C-ca", "C-cb", etc. And C-c DEL will uncolorize a colorized line.

;; (The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual says that minor modes should not
;; bind these keys --- they are "reserved for users" --- but it offers no
;; decent alternatives. The "c" in "C-c" stands for "color", so I'm using it.)

;; The colors are defined below. I could of course make them
;; more customizable, but since I'm the only user I didn't bother.

;; The stored file begins with "Color-Mode\n" and has ^@ or ^A or ^B
;; or ... at the beginning of each colorized line. The displayed file
;; uses the conventions of format.el in a simple way, sort of like a very
;; impoverished kind of enriched text.

;; I wrote and tested this with Emacs 20.4. It may fail with other versions.

;; It should be possible to use color mode together with enriched mode,
;; at least in simple files that don't depend on justification.
;; But you can't do that with Emacs 20.4 because of a bug in write-region
;; that I have just reported to GNU.

;; In color mode the normal stickiness conventions are reversed, because
;; we want to type at the beginning of a colorized line and inherit the
;; color of that line. Similarly, we want to type at the beginning of
;; a non-colorized line without inheriting the color of the newline
;; that ends the previous line. (I want the newline character to be
;; colorized, so that painting always extends to the right margin.)
;; The newline is made rear-nonsticky. All characters of a painted line
;; are made front-sticky; I don't want to do this just to the first character,
;; because the user can delete it.

;; If this mode is going to be used seriously in connection with other modes,
;; I could be more careful to confine the stickiness switching to the
;; text properties I control and not to any other attributes. But the
;; design of Emacs Lisp makes that rather painful, so I simply set
;; front-sticky and rear-nonsticky to `t' in this version of the code.
;; I'll let other people hack more generality into the routine if they
;; think it is worth their time.
