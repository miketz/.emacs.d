;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `standard-themes' are a pair of light and dark themes for GNU
;; Emacs.  They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which
;; technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them
;; thematic consistency, customizability, and extensibility.
;;
;; Why call them "standard"?  Obviously because: Standard Themes Are
;; Not Derivatives but the Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.

(defcustom standard-themes-headings nil
  "Heading styles with optional list of values per heading level.

This is an alist that accepts a (KEY . LIST-OF-VALUES)
combination.  The KEY is either a number, representing the
heading's level (0-8) or t, which pertains to the fallback style.
The named keys `agenda-date' and `agenda-structure' apply to the
Org agenda.

Level 0 is used for what counts as a document title or
equivalent, such as the #+title construct we find in Org files.
Levels 1-8 are regular headings.

The LIST-OF-VALUES covers symbols that refer to properties, as
described below.  Here is a complete sample with various
stylistic combinations, followed by a presentation of all
available properties:

    (setq standard-themes-headings
          (quote ((1 . (light variable-pitch 1.5))
                  (2 . (regular 1.3))
                  (3 . (1.1))
                  (agenda-date (1.3))
                  (agenda-structure (variable-pitch light 1.8))
                  (t . (variable-pitch)))))

By default (a nil value for this variable), all headings have a
normal typographic weight, a font family that is the same as the
`default' face (typically monospaced), and a height that is equal
to the `default' face's height.

- A `variable-pitch' property changes the font family of the
  heading to that of the `variable-pitch' face (normally a
  proportionately spaced typeface).  Also check the `fontaine'
  package (by Protesilaos) for tweaking fonts via faces.

- The symbol of a weight attribute adjusts the font of the
  heading accordingly, such as `light', `semibold', etc.  Valid
  symbols are defined in the variable `standard-themes-weights'.
  The absence of a weight means that no distinct weight will be
  used.

- A number, expressed as a floating point (e.g. 1.5), adjusts the
  height of the heading to that many times the base font size.
  The default height is the same as 1.0, though it need not be
  explicitly stated.  Instead of a floating point, an acceptable
  value can be in the form of a cons cell like (height . FLOAT)
  or (height FLOAT), where FLOAT is the given number.

Combinations of any of those properties are expressed as a list,
like in these examples:

    (semibold)
    (variable-pitch semibold)
    (variable-pitch semibold 1.3)
    (variable-pitch semibold (height 1.3))   ; same as above
    (variable-pitch semibold (height . 1.3)) ; same as above

The order in which the properties are set is not significant.

In user configuration files the form may look like this:

    (setq standard-themes-headings
          (quote ((1 . (light variable-pitch 1.5))
                  (2 . (regular 1.3))
                  (3 . (1.1))
                  (t . (variable-pitch)))))

When defining the styles per heading level, it is possible to
pass a non-nil value (t) instead of a list of properties.  This
will retain the original aesthetic for that level.  For example:

    (setq standard-themes-headings
          (quote ((1 . t)           ; keep the default style
                  (2 . (variable-pitch 1.2))
                  (t . (variable-pitch))))) ; style for all other headings

    (setq standard-themes-headings
          (quote ((1 . (variable-pitch 1.6))
                  (2 . (1.3))
                  (t . t)))) ; default style for all other levels"

For the style of the underline, a `neutral-underline' property
turns the color of the line into a subtle gray, while the
`no-underline' property removes the line altogether.  If both of
those are set, the latter takes precedence.

For text coloration, a `faint' property desaturates the color of
the text and the underline, unless the underline is affected by
the aforementioned properties.

A `bold' property applies a heavy typographic weight to the text
of the link.

An `italic' property adds a slant to the link's text (italic or
oblique forms, depending on the typeface).
